# Visual interfaces

Think of things as a mapping from the state to the visuals

Represent DOM using closure data structures

[:div.turbine-spinner {:class :speed-2 }]

Map abstract data into hiccup representation.

render! ( transform-to-markup (data) )

(bind! '#turbine-spinners'
  [:div#turbine-spinners
    (map spinner @turbines)
  ]
)

Only work in the forward direction.
