1. Discover principles of neocortex
2. Build systems based on these principles

Neocortex is a predictive modeling system

Makes predictions about what happens next
Detect anomolies
Generates actions

1. Hierachical system
2. Sequence memory
3. Sparse distributed representations

Dense representation (computers)
  Use all combinations of 1s and 0s and individual bits have no inherant meaning

Sparse distributed representations
  Many bits
  Few 1s, but mostly 0s
  Each bit is learned, not assigned

Sub sampling - just store indicies to some of the bits
